Every english sentence is built around the verb, which has a property of tense. What comes with the verb is the subject, a recipient, (represent the connections as ovals) and then there is an agent.

Place all the ingredients in a bowl and mix thoroughly Jane gave Tome an ice cream cone.

Transitive:
Prove the following axiom:

a=b & b=c then a=c

Attempts are below.

Given that:

if(a=b ^ b=c) -> (a=c)

What if not?
Equivalency Rules on Predicate Calculus, they are not the same thing.

!((a=b ^ b=c) -> (a=c)) because Resolution refutation 

(!(a=b ^ b=c) ^ !(a=c)) because !(p -> q) == p ^ !q

(a!=b v b!=c) ^ (a!=c) because !(A ^ B) == !A v !B

Falls apart here.

if(a=b ^ b=c) -> (a=c)

Assume True

a=b == True
b=c == True 

a=c == ? 

if(True ^ True) -> (a=c)

a=c == True becuase of the AND Truth Table. 

Assume False

a=b == False
b=c == False

a=c == ?

if(False ^ False) -> (False) becase of the AND Truth Table.

Since there were no contradictions by Resolution Refutation, this means that a=b ^ b=c -> a=c is True.

if(a=b ^ b=c) -> (a=c)

Let a = 1; b = 1; c = 1

1 = 1 = 1 == True

Final conclusion: a=b ^ b=c -> a=c is an axiom, meaning that it is something humans consider to be true and is the beginning of reasoning. 
Axioms cannot be proven because they are accepted to be true.
