The computer fetches instructions from the main memory, the hard drive, and 
the L1 cache.

0001 = Load, 0010 = Store, 0101 = Add

V = Voltage
I = Current
R = Resistance

V = I*R
I = V/R
R = V/I

X2 = 2*pi*f*c

ROM = Read only memory, non-volatile. There for keeps, storage
RAM = Random Access Memory, volatile. There to cycle data. 

Sequential Access = in order. Hard Disk Drive.
Direct Access = go directly to the address in the main memory. Solid State Drive.
Random Access = go directly to any location in the main memory randomly. 
Associative Access = relies on bits and pieces of the data to get to the whole
